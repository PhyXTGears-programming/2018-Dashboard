# 2018-Dashboard
The source code for our dashboard.

The frame has been reshaped to fit a 1336 by 768 resolution screen. With the drivestation in fullscreen mode.

Features cluster manipulation for file saving and sending config data that is not hardcoded and a configuation tab for calibrating the swerve drivetrain.
As well as a custom time remaining indicator reciving data sent from the robot that changes color based on hardcoded limits.

There is also legacy code from trying to store our auto on the drivestation laptop instead of hardcoding.

Although this is undocumented it should be straightforward with basic Labview knowlege.
